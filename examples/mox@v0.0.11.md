The Go software you provided implements a robust email server named "Mox." It's designed with a focus on security, modern standards compliance, and administrative ease. Here's a breakdown of its design:

**1. Configuration:**

- **Dual Configuration Files:** Mox utilizes two configuration files:
    - `mox.conf` (static): Defines unchanging parameters like data directory, hostname, logging, user to run as, global TLS settings, ACME (Let's Encrypt) configurations, and listener settings (IP addresses and services for SMTP, IMAP, HTTP).
    - `domains.conf` (dynamic):  Holds domain-specific configurations like accepted domains, user accounts (and their email addresses), web redirects, custom web handlers, routing rules for outgoing mail, and DNS blocklist monitoring.

**2. Core Components:**

- **SMTP Server:** Handles incoming email via SMTP and Submission protocols, including STARTTLS. It performs various checks:
    - Address validation: Rejects mail for non-existent users/domains (optionally obscuring this for deliveries).
    - SPF: Verifies sender IP against the domain's SPF record.
    - DKIM: Verifies DKIM signatures for sender domain legitimacy.
    - DMARC: Evaluates sender domain against its DMARC policy (rejecting if required).
    - Reputation: Analyzes sender history (IP, domain, recipients) to assess spam likelihood.
    - Junk Filter (optional): Uses a Bayesian filter to classify content as spam.
    - Rate Limiting: Limits connections and delivery attempts from IPs/networks to prevent abuse.
    - DNS Blocklists (DNSBLs): Can optionally reject mail from blacklisted IPs.
- **IMAP Server:** Allows users to access their email using the IMAP protocol (including IMAPS with TLS).
- **HTTP Server:**  Handles various web-related functionalities:
    - Admin interface:  Allows managing domains, accounts, mail queues, viewing reports, and more.
    - Account interface:  Lets users manage their settings (password, forwarding rules) and import/export email.
    - Webmail: Provides a web-based email client.
    - API endpoints:  Offers a JSON API for developers to interact with email programmatically.
    - Autoconfig/Autodiscover: Simplifies client setup for Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.
    - MTA-STS: Serves MTA-STS policies to enforce TLS connections.
- **Queue:** Manages outgoing messages, attempting delivery, retrying with backoff, and sending DSNs for failures.  
- **Data Storage:**  Uses a combination of BoltDB (via the `bstore` library) and file system:
    - BoltDB: Stores account information, mailboxes, messages metadata, subscriptions, reputation data, session information, and more.
    - File system:  Holds the raw message files in a directory structure within the account's data directory.

**3. Security:**

- **TLS:**
    - Opportunistic TLS: Used by default for mail delivery.
    - Enforced TLS:  Configurable with MTA-STS policies published by recipient domains.
    - DANE:  Supports DANE TLSA records for authenticating TLS connections without relying on CAs.
- **Authentication:**
    - SMTP Submission: Uses SASL mechanisms like SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS, CRAM-MD5, and PLAIN for secure authentication.
    - IMAP: Supports SASL mechanisms and the older LOGIN method.
    - Web: Employs session cookies and CSRF tokens to prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
- **Password Management:**
    - Account passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes.
    - Derived secrets are stored for various authentication mechanisms (CRAM-MD5, SCRAM).

**4. Features:**

- **Email Delivery:** Supports direct delivery, relaying via smarthosts (with authentication), and SOCKS proxies.
- **Junk Filtering:** Uses a Bayesian filter that can be trained by users.
- **DMARC Reporting:** Receives, parses, and stores aggregate reports. It also generates outgoing aggregate reports based on evaluations.
- **TLS Reporting:** Tracks TLS connection attempts and sends reports to domains that opt in.
- **Webhooks:** Offers webhooks for incoming deliveries and outgoing delivery events, allowing integration with external applications.
- **MTA-STS:** Enforces TLS connections with policies published by recipient domains.
- **Autoconfiguration:** Simplifies email client setup for Thunderbird and Microsoft Outlook.

**5. Design Choices:**

- **Strict Parsing:** Emphasizes adherence to standards, potentially rejecting slightly malformed input.
- **Concurrency:** Utilizes goroutines extensively for network operations, data processing, and background tasks.
- **Ephemeral Data Storage:** Stores temporary files (e.g. uploaded messages, composed DSNs) in a "tmp" directory within the data directory for easier cleanup.
