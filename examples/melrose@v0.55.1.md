Here are 10 structs from the provided code that likely have higher than average complexity, along with reasons for their complexity:

1. **`dsl.Evaluator`:** This struct is responsible for evaluating Melrose DSL expressions.  Parsing, interpreting, and managing variables and function calls inherently introduces complexity. The handling of assignments, expressions, and function lookups adds to this.

2. **`core.Loop`:**  Managing the playing of musical loops, handling concurrency (`sync.RWMutex`), scheduling, and dealing with real-time constraints makes this struct complex.  The interaction with the audio device and timeline further contributes.

3. **`midi.OutputDevice`:**  Sending MIDI messages, managing timing (`core.Timeline`), handling pedal events, and the interplay between notes and durations contribute to its complexity. The logic for scheduling events and combining MIDI events adds more intricacy.

4. **`core.Beatmaster`:** Keeping track of beats, bars, BPM changes, and scheduling events related to the musical beat introduces complexity. The management of the `BeatSchedule` and the real-time nature of its operations add to this.

5. **`control.Listen`:** Listening for MIDI input, managing callbacks, and keeping track of note on/off states introduce complexity.  The interaction with the MIDI device and the potential for concurrent access to note data necessitates careful synchronization.

6. **`formatParser`:** Parsing musical notation into Melrose data structures is a complex task, requiring handling of different syntaxes, error management, and potentially stateful parsing logic. The different *STM (state machine) structs within this package hint at this complexity.

7. **`server.LanguageServer`:** Handling HTTP requests, managing the interaction with the Melrose core, and providing language server features like inspection and evaluation add complexity.  The different handler functions and the need to deal with JSON serialization/deserialization contribute to this.

8. **`transport.mListener`:** This struct (and its implementations `RtListener` and `WASMListener`) manages MIDI input events, dispatching them to registered listeners. Handling concurrent access from multiple listeners and managing key-specific listeners adds complexity.

9. **`midi.DeviceRegistry`:**  Managing MIDI input and output devices, handling device initialization and closing, and coordinating with the `streamRegistry` contribute to its complexity.  The need to deal with different MIDI drivers (rtmidi, WASM) introduces platform-specific logic.

10. **`core.Timeline`:**  Scheduling and managing timed events, handling concurrent access, and maintaining the order of events add complexity to this struct. The `Play` function and the logic for traversing the linked list of scheduled events contribute to this.


These are just some of the potentially more complex structs.  Other structs like those dealing with parsing and complex musical structures (e.g., `Chord`, `Scale`, `Sequence`) could also be considered complex depending on their specific implementations. A proper complexity analysis using tools would be needed to provide a definitive ranking.
