The Go code you've provided implements a web-based interactive structure explorer, allowing users to visually navigate and inspect the contents of complex Go data structures. Let's break down its design:

**Core Components:**

1. **`explorer`:**
   - Serves as the central hub, managing the representation and exploration of data structures.
   - `accessMap`: A nested map storing `objectAccess` instances. The outer map represents rows in the UI, and the inner map represents columns.
   - `options`:  Holds configuration settings like HTTP port, base path, etc. 
   - `mutex`: Ensures thread-safety for concurrent access to the `accessMap`.

2. **`objectAccess`:**
   - Represents a specific element within a data structure and its position in the UI.
   - `object`: The actual Go value (struct, map, slice, etc.) being explored.
   - `path`:  A slice of strings acting as a "breadcrumb trail" to pinpoint the element's location within the nested structure (e.g., ["field1", "0", "key2"]).
   - `label`: A human-readable label for display in the UI.
   - `typeName`: Stores the type of the element (e.g., "[]string", "map[string]int").
   - `hideZeros`: A flag controlling whether zero values should be hidden in the UI.

3. **`fieldAccess`:**
   - Represents access to fields within a struct, elements in slices/arrays, or entries in maps.
   - `owner`: The parent object containing this field or element.
   - `key`:  The field name (for structs), index (for slices/arrays), or a hash of the key (for maps).
   - `label`: An optional user-friendly label for display.
   - `Type`:  The type of the field/element.

**Data Flow and User Interaction:**

1. **Initialization (`newExplorerOnAll`):**
   - The code creates a new `explorer` instance, populating it with initial key-value pairs representing the root-level structures to explore.
   - It validates if the provided values are explorable (structs, maps, slices).

2. **UI Representation (`indexData`, `indexDataBuilder`):**
   - The `explorer` constructs an `indexData` structure containing information needed to render the HTML table-based UI.
   - `indexDataBuilder` assists in organizing this data, generating labels, padding, and managing UI element IDs.

3. **User Navigation:**
   - JavaScript code (embedded in `scriptJS`) handles user interactions like expanding/collapsing structures and navigating the UI.
   - AJAX requests are sent to the server (`serveInstructions`) with instructions based on user actions (e.g., expand this row, remove this element).

4. **Server-Side Updates:**
   - The server (using `serveInstructions`) processes user commands, updates the `explorer`'s internal state (`accessMap`), and sends back a minimal response.
   - The UI is dynamically updated using JavaScript based on these responses.

**Key Design Choices:**

- **Web-Based Visualization:** Provides a platform-independent and familiar way to interact with data structures.
- **Hierarchical Representation:** Uses a table-based layout to naturally visualize the nested nature of structures.
- **Client-Server Architecture:** Leverages AJAX for a responsive UI while keeping the core logic on the server-side.
- **Reflection:**  Heavily relies on Go's `reflect` package to dynamically inspect and traverse data structures at runtime.

**Note:** I have focused solely on describing the existing design as requested, without suggesting improvements.
